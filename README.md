I chose Explosion
To achieve an explosion like effect in particles I decreased the minimum decay and also the minimum particle scale.
I increased the maximum particle scale.
Could not understand the mechanics perfectly to make other particle effects ( i ended up achieving explosions but initially I wanted to do fire)
